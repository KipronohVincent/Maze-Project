### Introduction

- [About Kruskal Algorithm](https://www.google.co.id/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj7u8nykb3TAhUCa7wKHUYZBYcQFggsMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKruskal%2527s_algorithm&usg=AFQjCNFRRZYfMjMX2s_2V_zHPI03tmnP4A&sig2=NXH3jqAsJtBiHfGz1zL3vQ)
	
    Kruskal’s algorithm is a method for producing a minimal spanning tree from a weighted graph. The algorithm I’ll cover here is actually a randomized version of Kruskal’s; the original works something like this:

    - Throw all of the edges in the graph into a big burlap sack. (Or, you know, a set or something.)
    - Pull out the edge with the lowest weight. If the edge connects two disjoint trees, join the trees. Otherwise, throw that edge away.
    - Repeat until there are no more edges left. [Learn More Here](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm)

- **Maze Feature**
    - Generate new layout "C"
    - Change Object player "P"
    - Change view "V" (2 Dimension, 3 Dimension, Fps)
    - Move the player **Up:"W" | Down:"S" | Left:"A" | Right:"D"**
    - Rotate maze **-YAxis:"J" | -XAxis:"K" | XAxis:"I" | XAxis:"L"** (Only In 3dimension)
    - Action For Key --> **1,2,3,4,5**
        -  Key 1 -> Active/Deactive Ambient Light
        -  Key 2 -> Active/Deactive Diffuse Light
        -  Key 3 -> Active/Deactive Specular Light
        -  Key 4 -> Change The Day (Background)
        -  Key 5 -> Change Wall Transparant or Not
    - Change Maze size , **"+" to Increase and "-" to Decrease**
    - Arroy Key To Walk Inside Maze While in Fps Mode (ArrowKeyUP , ArrowKeyDOWN , ArrowKeyLEFT, ArrowKeyRIGHT) 
    - Change Nim (ID) Rotation Using Mouse Click (Left,Center,Right)
    - Space to Run/Stop another one player.
 
### Build & Run 
- **Windows**  
    - Required ... 
To Run This Program In Windows You Can Use The Codeblock IDE ([Get Here](https://www.google.co.id/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjIp8ONmr3TAhVBNpQKHQfJDUQQFggkMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.codeblocks.org%2Fdownloads&usg=AFQjCNGin5_gzph-iFTEZ-NsXkpwypBBNQ&sig2=L7-9vYIUSTwdC01iQdkVJQ)) After That Follow The Instructions The Installation With The Addition Of The Opengl Api ([Learn Here](http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~goetz/codeblocks/glut/)).  
    - _How To Run :_  
        ```sh
        - Create A New Project Glut/Opengl Project
        - Just Copy Paste The Code In Your main.Cpp Has Been Made
        - Build & Run
        ```
- **Linux**  
    - You Can Use The Codeblock For Linux As Well.  
    - You Can Execute Your Code Using A Text Editor That You Love. Like Atoms, Sublime,Geany Or Another.  

  Before Executing, You Must Install Some Dependenci Of Glut On Linux. What You Need To Do Is (Installation Via Terminal):  
    - Install The Compiler And Necessary Tools.A Fairly Complete Compiler You Can Use G++, How to : 
        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install g++ cmake 
        ```
    - Install Freeglut :
        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
        ```
    - Run Using Terminal : 
        ```sh
        gcc -o excecutebin filename.cpp -lglut -lGL -lm -lGLU -lstdc++
        ```
### Documentation  
- **V-1.0**  
    - In This Version, The Object The Player Can Still Penetrate The Wall  
    - Object Player Running (Right, Left, Bottom, Top) With Magnitude 0.1.

    - When 3dviewmode, maze can rotation by I,J,K,L
    - Nim rotation can change by mouse click (left,center,right)
    - Change maze size using **"+"** to increase and **"-"** to decrease
- **V-3.0**  
    - Have 3 different view, 2d, 3d, Fps
    - Can walk inside the maze using arrowKey when fps viewmode 
    - Active / Deactive 3 Light usign 1,2,3 Key
    - Tranparant Wall usign the 5 Key
    - Day or Night usign the 4 key
    - Spaace to Run/Stop another one player.
